# Discord.JS v14 TypeScript Template
A simple template for making Discord.JS bots with TypeScript. \
Saves a fair bit of time in the setup process!
## Things to Change
When using this template, make sure to change:
- The package.json file (insert your package details)
- This README.md file
Also, make sure to copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`, and put your token in it!
## Credits
A lot of this is based on [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide), adapted for TypeScript!
